Installation
============
You need to have a working version of Python 3 installed
(Python 2 may work but is untested for now.)
If this requirement is met, you can install the latest stable version
of ``k2mosaic`` using pip::

    pip install k2mosaic

If you have a previous version installed, you can upgrade it using::

    pip install k2mosaic --upgrade

Or you can install the most recent development version
from the git repository as follows::

    git clone https://github.com/barentsen/k2mosaic.git
    cd k2mosaic
    python setup.py install

The ``setup.py`` script will automatically take care of installing the dependencies
and add the ``k2mosaic`` tool to the command line.
